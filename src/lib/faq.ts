    question: "What is your favourite web framework?",
    answer: "NextJs has got to be my favourite framework. The ability to decide the rendering pattern that's best for your app and the amazing list of libraries build by the community around the framework make it really easy to build full-stack typesafe and fast webapps, plus the new changes introduced in Next13 with server components will make the rendering patterns even more easy and intuitive. I also like Angular, Sveltekit and Astro.",

    question: "Thoughts on Angular?",
